# Scheduler CHOP Plugin for TouchDesigner

**Scheduler CHOP** is a custom C++ plugin designed to bring powerful time-based scheduling capabilities to your TouchDesigner projects. With this plugin, you can trigger events or control behaviors based on global or day-specific schedules, making it perfect for interactive installations, performances, and time-sensitive tasks.

## Features

### âœ… Global Scheduling Mode
- Configure a single time range that applies across all days.
- Automatically disables day-specific schedules to prevent conflicts.

### âœ… Day-Specific Scheduling
- Set unique schedules for each day of the week.
- Define start and end times down to the second for precise control.

### âœ… Trigger Logic
- Outputs a `Trigger` channel that indicates whether the schedule is active (`1`) or inactive (`0`).
- Includes a user-defined interval to prevent multiple rapid triggers.

### âœ… Dynamic UI
- Automatically grays out day-specific parameters when Global Mode is enabled.
- Makes the interface intuitive and avoids misconfigurations.

### âœ… High Performance
- Runs efficiently at 60Hz for real-time applications.

#### Global Mode
- **Global Mode Toggle**: Enables or disables global scheduling.
- **Global Start/End Time**: Set the start and end times for the global schedule.
